The HAANGRY App. 

I've been really into cooking lately and always have trouble thinking of new things to cook. Then when I think of something, I have to read through paragraphs and paragraphs of backstory just to get to the ingredients. Spoonacular API is vast and I'm leveraging just a part of it, but I've learned a lot, as I intended when beginning this project. 

Made using TypeScript and React.
